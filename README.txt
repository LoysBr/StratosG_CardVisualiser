TIME SPENT : 4 hours for basic implementation (until commit 42757a8)

Then I was quite interested with the exercise of trying to make it "data driven" since I'm not a pro of ScriptableObjects and I have never did such
a thing so I wanted to give a try, only by myself, without any help of the internet. 

So I took around 7 more hours. 

I think it's not finished : we still cannot add a new Card with only Data !! 

I checked internet for similar stuff and found "Unity Atoms" which seems quite interesting to bring such modularity.
